Killer KB-Simmony bass guitar played and mapped by D. Smolken.
SFZ mappings including string release samples and various noises.
There is one file for regular mappings, one clean (no release samples), one unison (all round robins at once), and finally one shifty (five unison voices created by shifting some higher-pitched notes down).
Fifths tuning (CGDA) though the low C string was also sampled tuned down to A and F#. The strings are roundwounds, about two years old. All samples recorded direct, using neck pickup only, with no effects and the onboard EQ set flat.
Notes have five velocity layers and three round robins, release samples four round robins, noises five round robins.
